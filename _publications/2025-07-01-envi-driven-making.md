excerpt: 'This paper is developed primarily using Houdini, where CFD data continuously informs the generation of geometry, tool paths, and 3DP instructions. A customized slicing tool and G-code generator are implemented to produce G-code programs responsive to CFD data. Unlike conventional 3DP practices, this integrated approach enables the production of environmentally responsive surface textures, establishing a continuous link between environmental factors, design generation, and digital fabrication.'

**[Abstract:]** Digital fabrication is often regarded as a distinct materialization process, separate from design, resulting in a disconnection between digital models and their physical making. This paper introduces a generative framework for environmental-driven making using ceramic 3D printing (3DP). The study examines the plastic deformation of 3DP ceramic and integrates computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation data to regulate deformation within the design. This approach generates surface textures with different roughness that can potentially influence the bio-receptivity, through which it creates niches for microbial colonization while also contributing to aesthetic considerations. The framework is developed primarily using Houdini, where CFD data continuously informs the generation of geometry, tool paths, and 3DP instructions. A customized slicing tool and G-code generator are implemented to produce G-code programs responsive to CFD data. Unlike conventional 3DP practices, this integrated approach enables the production of environmentally responsive surface textures, establishing a continuous link between environmental factors, design generation, and digital fabrication.
