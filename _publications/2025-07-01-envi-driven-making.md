title: "Environmental-driven Making: Clay 3D Printing Instructed by Airflow Data"
collection: publications
category: conferences
permalink: /publication/2025-07-01-envi-driven-making
excerpt: 'This paper is developed primarily using Houdini, where CFD data continuously informs the generation of geometry, tool paths, and 3DP instructions. A customized slicing tool and G-code generator are implemented to produce G-code programs responsive to CFD data. Unlike conventional 3DP practices, this integrated approach enables the production of environmentally responsive surface textures, establishing a continuous link between environmental factors, design generation, and digital fabrication.'
