**[Abstract:]** The study investigates the impact of macroscale porosity on deformation in 4D-printed hygromorphic bilayer structures, focusing on applications in building envelopes. Aiming to reduce cost and material use, the research, inspired by biomimetic principles, investigates the combination of an active layer with high moisture responsiveness (printed with wood filament) and a passive layer (fabricated with normal PLA) for structural stability. The qualitative relationship between porosity in the active and passive layers and the deformation parameters are assessed in three experiments. Results reveal that (1) active layer porosity (Pₐ) is directly related to response speed, (2) passive layer porosity (Pₚ) significantly affects deformation magnitude, (3) a balanced porosity ratio (Rₚ) between layers enables controlled, predictable shape transformation. Findings from the experiments inform a proposed design application consisting of three prototypes that demonstrate the potential for adaptive building envelopes which dynamically adjust to environmental humidity, providing energy-efficient shading. This work contributes a novel framework for programmable material design, achieving maximum architectural functionalities with minimal material use. Furthermore, it lays the groundwork for further exploration of cross-scale porosity design, aiming to optimize precise deformation control in adaptive architectural systems.
