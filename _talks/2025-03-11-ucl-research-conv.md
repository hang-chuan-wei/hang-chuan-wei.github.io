**[Abstract:]** The negative impact of contemporary built environments on human microbiome health has led researchers and designers to reconsider the way we shape our cities in relation to microbes. This has informed a shift from so-called antibiotic to probiotic thinking. Building on the probiotic theory, the research of probiotic modelling integrates knowledge from microbiome science, architecture, and digital technologies to address the emerging health challenges of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and immunoregulation. It examines the material and immaterial aspects of subjects and develops computational methodologies for understanding, analyzing, and intervening the indoor microbiome.
